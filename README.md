# Amber: Nostr event signer for Android

Amber is a nostr event signer for Android. It allows users to keep their nsec segregated in a single, dedicated app. The goal of Amber is to have your smartphone act as a NIP-46 signing device without any need for servers or additional hardware. "Private keys should be exposed to as few systems as possible as each system adds to the attack surface," as the rationale of said NIP states. In addition to native apps, Amber aims to support all current nostr web applications without requiring any extensions or web servers.

# Security and Verification

üîê **All releases are cryptographically signed with GPG for your security.**

Before installing any APK from our releases, we strongly recommend verifying its authenticity to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.

**[üìã View Release Verification Guide](VERIFY_RELEASES.md)**

The verification process involves:
1. Importing our GPG public key
2. Verifying the release manifest signature
3. Checking file integrity with SHA256 hashes

**GPG Key Details:**
- **Key ID**: `44F0AAEB77F373747E3D5444885822EED3A26A6D`
- **Fingerprint**: `44F0 AAEB 77F3 7374 7E3D  5444 8858 22EE D3A2 6A6D`
- **User ID**: `greenart7c3 <greenart7c3@proton.me>`

**Quick verification:**
```bash
# Import the signing key
gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys 44F0AAEB77F373747E3D5444885822EED3A26A6D

# Verify a release (example for v1.0.0)
gpg --verify manifest-v1.0.0.txt.sig manifest-v1.0.0.txt
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice**: Only download releases from this official GitHub repository. If GPG verification fails, **do not install the APK** and report it as a security issue.

# Verifying Reproducibility of Amber

To confirm that the Amber build is reproducible, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command to build the image with no cache and specified version:

``` bash
docker build -t amber-repro --progress=plain --no-cache --build-arg VERSION=v4.0.2 --build-arg APK_TYPE=free-arm64-v8a .
```

2. After the image is built, run the container:

``` bash
docker run --rm amber-repro
```

3. You should see the following message indicating success:

``` bash
APKs match!
```
